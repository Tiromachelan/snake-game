A simple snake game coded in Java using Princeton's StdDraw graphics library.

To play the game, ensure that Snake.java and StdDraw.java are in the same folder.  Then compile and run Snake.java.

Use the arrow keys to move.

Note that StdDraw.java uses a deprecated API so you may get error messages when running on newer versions of Java, but it should still run.
